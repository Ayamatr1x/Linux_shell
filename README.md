# Linux_shell
This project is a minimal Linux shell implemented in C, designed to mimic the basic behavior of a command-line interpreter. It reads user input, tokenizes commands, handles white space, and prepares the structure for executing those commands. The shell demonstrates foundational system programming concepts such as input parsing, memory management, and modular design. It serves as a great learning tool for understanding how Unix-like shells work under the hood.
